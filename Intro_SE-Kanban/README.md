# KanbanProject
Kanban is a project management methodology that allows for organizing and
prioritizing projects and their tasks, using boards, lists, and cards. With the right
Kanban board software, one can focus on priorities, keep the team in the loop about
what’s current and what’s coming up, and control a steady flow of work, especially in
output-heavy environments like production, agencies, support, and maintenance.
This is a tool that supports agile development and helps to visualize and manage the
workflow.
